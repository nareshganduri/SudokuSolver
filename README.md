# SudokuSolver

A sudoku solver implemented in JavaScript. It uses a fairly naive backtracking algorithm, so particularly difficult puzzles can take several minutes to solve.

Furthermore, there is no input validation whatsoever as the primary focus was to get the backtracking algorithm working correctly.
